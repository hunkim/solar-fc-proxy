        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to 
        the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define 
        the field as the study of intelligent agents: any device that perceives its environment 
        and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. 
        Colloquially, the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines 
        that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as 
        learning and problem solving. The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research 
        include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language 
        processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.

        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. 
        While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human 
        activities have been the main driver of climate change since the 1800s. Burning fossil 
        fuels like coal, oil, and gas produces greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket 
        wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. The main 
        greenhouse gases that are causing climate change are carbon dioxide and methane. These 
        come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. 
        Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, 
        oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, 
        transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing 
        greenhouse gas emissions.

        Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
        It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from 
        data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine 
        learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order 
        to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine 
        learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, 
        email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or 
        unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
